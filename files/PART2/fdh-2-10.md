# Map Systems

## Theses

1) Maps are characterised by a long history of innovations from triangulation to Geographical Information Systems

2) It is important to model these changes in order to organise maps as systems. 

## Maps as abstraction, maps as sequences of operations

Maps are memories. But memories of what ?

- A map is an abstraction of concrete territory
- A map is the result of coordinated sequences of operations. As operations get more sophisticated the map as a memory system changes. Ideally we would like to be able to retrieve all the operations “stored” in the map.

To be capable of processing maps from different periods, one must well understand the history of mapping… and how to translate the information contain in old maps using the logics of recent Geographical Information Systems. 

## History of mapping technologies

### Odometry

How did Leonardo da Vinci built the first aerial view of a city in 1502 ?

### Triangulation

Snellius (1580-1626)

### Coordinate systems

Meridian. Paris Observatory

Cassini Map

### Definition of the metric system

Measure of the Meridian by Mechain et Delambre 

Definition of the metric system

### Technical drawing and projection

### Cadaster

First cadaster in 1726 in Geneva

Napoleon Cadaster

Generalization in the 19th century. 

### Aerial photography

Nadar.

The Sampling vs Modelling duality

## Geographical Information Systems

### Vector Data

### Raster Data

### Coordinate Systems

The earth is not a sphere or an ellispoid

Level of see is not a constant measure for point 0 in altitude. 

It is changing over years, during the day and is not equal at a given moment in different point of the Earth. 

Projection systems

If you want both correct shapes and area you must work on local coordianate system.

## Summary 

Maps are organised information systems. Starting from contemporary geographic information system it is possible to go back in time and redocument more ancient systems. 

## In the next chapter

We will see how to process maps.
