# Map Systems

## Theses

1) Maps are characterised by a long history of innovations from triangulation to Geographical Information Systems

2) It is important to model these changes in order to organise maps as systems.

## Definitions

### Place

> Definition: Place
>
> Non-ambigous symbolic area, typically defined in relation with other small or bigger areas. 

- Names

- Type (Natural geography, populated place, administrative unit i.e cadastral parcel)

- Localisation in time (points, surface, volume)

- Unique ID

### Gazeeteers and Geocoding services

Dictionary of places. 

- Google API. 
- Geonames, 
-  http://whgazetteer.org

Geocoding services

- Geopy : geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services. geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources. https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

### Concrete Shape

> Definition: Concrete Shape
>
> Concrete shape is the actual and precise frontier of the place on the territory at a given moment in time

France is defined a series of diachronic concrete shapes. 

Concrete shape change over time. Evolution of concrete shapes can be modelled at a very high precision (month or day). 

### Geometries

> Definition: Geometry
>
> A geometry is logical combination of polygons in relation to another surface (document map, GIS layer)

Each concrete shape can be approximate by different geometries that differ in terms of scale and ways of modelling (lines, polygons) or more generally logical combination of polygons  (to deal with wholes and disjoint shapes)

Each polygon is defined by a set of a (control) points. 

Between the point their could line or at higher degree splines. 

Is it better to approximate concrete forms as set of lines or points (one id per points or line) or as polygons (one id per polygons) ?

Better by lines. Coding geometries as set of lines gives more freedom and efficiency for coding evolution of concrete shapes. 

Lines can stored in a single table. 

### Pivot Point

> Definition: Point
>
> A Point is the intersection of at least two lines.

As soon as the point exist in different spaces it becomes a Pivot Points 

> Definition: Pivot Point
>
> A Pivot Point is zero dimensonsial enity with a unique id representing the same coordinate in various spaces (documents, GIS)

Points are defined as the intersection of at least two lines.

A point can have a unique id and corresponding coordinates on documents and geometries, and link with other points. 

When one create a new point on a geometries this new control point is also inserted in the map geometries. 

## Maps as abstraction, maps as sequences of operations

Maps are memories. But memories of what ?

- A map is an abstraction of concrete territory
- A map is the result of coordinated sequences of operations. As operations get more sophisticated the map as a memory system changes. Ideally we would like to be able to retrieve all the operations “stored” in the map.

To be capable of processing maps from different periods, one must well understand the history of mapping… and how to translate the information contain in old maps using the logics of recent Geographical Information Systems.

## History of mapping technologies

### Odometry

How did Leonardo da Vinci built the first aerial view of a city in 1502 ?

### Triangulation

Snellius (1580-1626)

### Coordinate systems

Meridian. Paris Observatory

Cassini Map

### Definition of the metric system

Measure of the Meridian by Mechain et Delambre

Definition of the metric system

### Technical drawing and projection

### Cadaster

First cadaster in 1726 in Geneva

Napoleon Cadaster

Generalization in the 19th century.

### Aerial photography

Nadar.

The Sampling vs Modelling duality

## Geographical Information Systems

### Vector Data

### Raster Data

### Coordinate Systems

The earth is not a sphere or an ellispoid

Level of see is not a constant measure for point 0 in altitude.

It is changing over years, during the day and is not equal at a given moment in different point of the Earth.

Projection systems

- Mercator
- Lambert
- WGS84

If you want both correct shapes and area you must work on local coordianate system.

### Layers

One of the central concept of current GIS are layers. 

### BIM

Extension of the concept of GIS to each building 

## Summary

Maps are organised information systems. Starting from contemporary geographic information system it is possible to go back in time and redocument more ancient systems.

## In the next chapter

We will see how to process maps. 

## Questions from Students
How hard is it to go from one coordinate system to another?
