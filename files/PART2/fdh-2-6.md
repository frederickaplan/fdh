# 3D

## Concepts

Modelling vs Sampling : 

### Modelling

Model-based Procedural methods. Architectural grammars. Class I and Class II elements. The question of realism. (maybe moved to part 3)

### Sampling

Intro

- Different methods : Lidar, etc. 
- Finding a compromise between time and precision. 
- Using standard camera or dedicated scanners (for instance LIDAR)
- Iterated Scanning
- Visualisation of the scans



Principles of Phtogrammetry. 

Homologous Points. Odometry. Desification. Adjacent graph. 

Calibration

Evaluation of precision of models

### Mirror Worlds and 4D

Digital epiderm. 

Augmented Reality. 

## Practice

### How do conduct a photogrammetric campaign

### Using a Procedural software (e.g. Houdini)
