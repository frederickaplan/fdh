# 3D

## Concepts

Modelling vs Sampling : 

### Modelling

Model-based Procedural methods. Architectural grammars. Class I and Class II elements. The question of realism. (maybe moved to part 3)

### Sampling

Intro

- Different methods : Lidar, Time of Flight
- Finding a compromise between time and precision. 
- Using standard camera or dedicated scanners (for instance LIDAR)
- Iterated Scanning
- Visualisation of the scans



Principles of Phtogrammetry. 

Homologous Points. Odometry. Desification. Adjacent graph. 

Calibration

Evaluation of precision of models



### OcTree

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree

Wikipedia : An **octree** is a [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure) in which each [internal node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_node) has exactly eight [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_node). Octrees are most often used to partition a [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space) by [recursively subdividing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_subdivision) it into eight octants. Octrees are the three-dimensional analog of [quadtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree). The name is formed from *oct* + *tree*, but note that it is normally written "*octree*" with only one "t". Octrees are often used in [3D graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_graphics) and 3D [game engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine).

The use of octrees for [3D computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) was pioneered by Donald Meagher at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute), described in a 1980 report "Octree Encoding: A New Technique for the Representation, Manipulation and Display of Arbitrary 3-D Objects by Computer",[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree#cite_note-1) for which he holds a 1995 patent (with a 1984 [priority date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_right)) "High-speed image generation of complex solid objects using octree encoding" [[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree#cite_note-2)
