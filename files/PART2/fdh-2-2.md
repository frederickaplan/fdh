## Use Cases

### Extracting content from Newspapers

- Newspapers : the first rought draft of history / *Washington Post* 1963
- Extracts from Impresso :
  -  "Be it radio broadcasts from the 1940s or print newspapers of the 19th century, historical media record wars and minor events, report on international, national, and local matters, and offer insights into the day-to-day lives of past societies; in a word, they keep track of the great and small history. As historical sources they also reflect the political, social, and economic environments in which they were produced and hold dense, continuous, and multi-level information which makes them invaluable for scholars. "
  - Intrinsic history. Extrinsic history of the media. "Additional information such as knowing who commissioned and authored them and when they were published may reveal additional insights into larger societal and socio-technical processes. In other words, historical research is driven by the creation of links between their objects of study through a continuous, iterative, and cumulative process characterised by comparison, contrasting and associating concepts. It is our goal to transpose and expand this hitherto purely analogue practice into a data-driven practice in the digital sphere so as to be able to consider levels of meaning which can only be made visible by computational processing."
