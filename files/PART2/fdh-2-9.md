# Image Understanding

## Theses

1) Image understanding, like text understanding, is interpreting images in terms of events and agents

2) the semantic gap between low-level descriptors and semantic concepts have been partially filled



### Image systems based on concepts

> Definition : The connection between two digital images is said to be conceptual if it is possible to assert, from the visual information only, that they are characterised by the same concept

ImageNet is an example of an image system based on concept. 

**ImageNet** is organized according to the nouns of the [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) hierarchy. Each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds or thousands of images (five hundred images per node on average). 

ImageNet played a crucial role for bootstrapping generic deep learning based machine vision architecture. 

This is a crucial aspect of image systems, they enable to bootstrap more advanced machine vision architecture. 

Other option : Image systems based on GeoTags. Question of the Gridsize or problem of regression.

The MediaPipe framework allows for parallelization and thread optimization of image processing routines on a per-process basis.
