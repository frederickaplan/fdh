# Writing Systems

## Theses

1) Many Writing Systems Exist

2) They get transformed when operationalised by a new technology (Printing press, Digital Computer)

3) Ways of writing handwritten and printed texts change over time. 

## Scripts 

### Scripts and Writing Systems

Writing permits to record language in medium more permanent than speech, using a script. 

A script is a set of conventional symbols that can be used to represent in writing one or more languages. 

Components of a script are characters or more generally graphemes. 

A writing system is the use of a script in a particular language. The writing systems defines rules and convention on how to interpret the scripts. 

### Characters and Glyphs

The graphical representation of a character is called a Glyph. 

One character may be represented by different Glyphs (depending of positions (character sigma σ or [ς](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ς#Greek) , arabic characters), handwritings, typefaces)

A Glyph may not correspond to a single character (& is a ligature of “e” and “t” and represents “et” or “and”)

### The Process of converting Speech into Text and Text into Speech

Scripts and Writing Systems formalisation can be interpreted as Speech2Text and Text2Speech technology. 

### Scripts Typologies

Many Scripts exist or have existed

Pictographic/ideographic : Ideograms representing Concepts (rather than Words) (Aztec, Adinkra used in modern Ghana, ..)

Logographic : Glyphs represent Words or Morphemes (Egyptian, Mayan, Chinese)

Syllabaries : Glyphs represent syllables (Japanese Kana, Cherokee)

Segmental scripts : Glyphs represent phonemes. Some have only consonants (Like Hebrew) and some are True Alphabet (Greek, Latin, Cyrillic)

Non linear alphabets are composed of something other than lines on a surface

\- Braille

\- Morse codes

\- International Maritime Signal Flags

### Undeciphered systems and documents 

There are still undeciphered systems that could be writing systems 

\- Cretan hieroglyphs

\- Indus Valley Civilization scripts

\- Linear A (Minoan)

\- Phaistos Disc

There are also recent manuscript writing in undeciphered and unidentified writing systems. Some of them could be hoaxes. 

E.g Voynich manuscript 

### Operationalisation of Scripts

Scripts get operationalised. Writing systems evolve over time. Most importanly, they can be operationalised using mechanic or digital technology. This causes profound transformation of their diffusion and usage. 

McLuhan : The Phonetic Alphabet and then the Printing Press have changed the human mind. With the creation of the movable type, the invention of the “Typographic man” at the Renaissance permits the standardisation and centralisation. For McLuhan, the electronics and the digital announces the a new era, a great mutation, a return to orality. 

Each writing system have a profound effect cognitive and cultural effect. They exert a “gravitational effect” on cognition.  Print technology made possible salient trends in the Western World : individualism, democracy, Protestantism, capitalism and nationalism. They are all based on "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification”. 

## Handwritten texts

### Evolution of handwritten texts

Reading difficulty changes with time but paradoxically it is not necessary the older document that are the most difficult to recognised. 

The more writting skills get diffuse in the population, the less standardised are the handwritten documents. 

The handwriting found in some medieval manuscript is often more regular than modern handwriting. 

In the Carolingian minuscule, the script used in Charlemangne’s empire and its successor states (800-1200) letters and words are clearly separated. 

### Abbreviations

Medieval texts are highly “compressed”

One of the central skills in paleography is understanding abbreviations and expanding them correctly. 

Major reference works date from the 19th century.

\- Chassant (1845)

\- Trice Martin (1892)

\- Cappelli (1899)

Three systems of abbreviation in the antiquity (only indirect evidence as no Roman manuscript is known as an autograph) 

\- Tironian notae (system for making quick transcriptions)

\- Notae Iuris (abbreviations used by the legal profession)

\- Nomina Sacra (abbreviations found in early Christian writings)

Motivation for abbreviations : 

\- save space or to save time, but not only : 

\- language-independent communication in a multilingual environment 

\- the avoidance of using a sacred name 

\- allegoric, ritualistic, and occult purposes related to alchemical and magical symbols

Examples 

Suspension : abbreviating a word by omitting a number of characters at the end

AUG. ‘Augustus’ 

ib. ‘ibidem’ 

fq ‘filius quondam’

R.I.P. ‘Requiescat in pace’

D. ‘Dux’ or ‘Dominus’

MSS. ‘Manuscripta’ or ‘Manuscripts’

pp. ‘pages’

Contraction : omitting letters from the middle of the word.

caplo ‘capitulo’ 

ds ‘deus’

Signs which indicate the presence of an abbreviation

sign ***ꝯ\*** may stand for ‘con-’ and ‘com-’ when in word-initial position

The superscript letters: specific type of abbreviations in which part of the abbreviated word, often the last letter, is written above the line

w_t ‘with’

Special signs include symbols used for common words, monetary units (£ € $), alchemical, astrological, magical and hermetic symbols.

MNIST and others

## Printed Texts

### The Printing Revolution 

Printed texts are noting but uniform in time. In practice they cover a 500y old period.

Printing with woodblocks started in China in the 9th century. 

Metal movable-type printing began to be used in Korea, 400y later. 

But it is in Europe that printing became a revolution. 

Before 1450, all books were written by hand. In 1455 the Gutenberg Bible was printed in Mainz. 

Fifty years after, millions of printed books circulated around Europe. Only 500 000 survive today. 

A technical-industrial process born in the middle of the 15th century in a strip of land between France and Germany, a kind of “Silicon Valley” of that time. 

The medieval world was changing with urbanisation and growth of mercantile classes. Demographic decline following the Black Death in 1348 and subsequent wars result in a a rise of labour costs and the search for innovation. 

The use of paper has driven down book-production costs.

Metal was taking over from wood in every technological process. 

And more importantly, there was a demand for more and more books. 

### Typefaces

Seven typefaces were developed im the 15th century. They imitate the hand of scribes. 

- Roman
- Gotic
- Batarde
- Greek
- Hebrew
- Glagolitico
- Italic

As most printers had their own sets cuts, there was a huge variety of letter-forms within a typeface style. 

### Redocumentaion of handwritten books

In the early years of printing the goal was to redocument as quickly and economically as possible handwritten books. The printed books needed to look as close to the manuscripts as possible. 

What survies today from 1450-1500: 28 0000 editions in 500 000 copies conserved in 4000 public libraries but also in un unknown number of private collections. 

The largest majority of them are in Latin (21 329), the language of communication across Europe. Latin is followed by German (3308) , Italien (2433) , French (1780), Deutsch (571), Spanish (437), English (240) and Hebrew (154).

Most common subjects : Theology (4928), Law (4480), Literature and Classics (4313), Liturgy (2245), Devotional Literature (1893), Moral Literature (1499), Philosophy (1476), Current affaires (1041), Medicine (940), Ecclesiastical History (725), History (678), Bible (337), Natural Philosophy (265), Mathematics (98), Geographia (88), Agriculture and Music (55), Architecture and Engineering (22).

### Evolution of Typography

Letraset popularised Lorem Ipsum

The Macintosh introduced a confusion in terms of terminology.

A typeface is the design of lettering that can include variations, such as extra bold, bold, regular, light, italic, condensed, extended, etc. 

Each of these variations of the typeface is a font.

But many people use the term “Font” to refer to Typeface

## Spellings

Modern languages are taught in school, well-documented by grammars and dictionnaries. 

Modern languages have standard orthographies. This makes it possible to correct misspellings. 

Large amount of text are available for modern languages. Even for small languages, there are typically large newspaper or adminstrative corpora to train train text processing techniques. 

Historical languages often do not benefit from a standard orthography. A word may be spelled differently by the same author in the same text. Most Text Processing techniques assume that a word is always written in the same way. 

Spelling variation exist in modern language (e.g. American vs British spellings) but is much rather and well documented. 

Spelling is not limited to the spelling of individual words, it also concern punctuation, abbreviations, hyphenation, word separation. 

There are many examples of spelling change and rectification in French, Dutch, German, etc. 

This is also true for Chinese, Turkish, Korean, Mongolian. 

Change occurs diachronically but also synchronically. 

Often, most ancient text written in an historical form of the language get redocumented using the new form (sometimes more complex like in French)

Most digital historical texts are not originals but transcriptions. Different types of transcriptions exist

Diplomatic transcription : render every feature of the original text the can be reproduced including page layout, line breaks, original spelling and errors

At the other extreme :

Fully modernised transcription : Spelling and layout is transformed to facilitate reading and dissemination. Scholars may consider this a translation more than a transcription. 

Any transcription and redocumentation implies some interpretation and remapping. Therefore in most case the a digital text is the results of complex sequence of redocumentation process. 

In general, spelling variations do decrease over time. 

## Summary

Historical texts are challenging because they use ancient Writing Systems that needs to be redocumented in contemporary forms. 

## In the next chapter 

We will see how to encode an historical text digitally
