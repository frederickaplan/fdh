# Image systems

<!--This chapter needs to be rewritten on the basis a taxonomy of 4 image systems. Please wait before improving it--> 

## Theses

1) Images like texts can be represented as systems

2) They can be articulated in reference to an external reality 

3) But other forms of “similarities” exist

## Definition

We have seen what a Writing System is. What are Image systems?

> Definition : An Image system is a graph of connected digital images and a set of rules for deciding when two images are linked. 

## Homologous pairs and Physical closure

We have seen what homologous pairs are. Images can be articulated with one another if they overlap the same physical reality. This reality is made of pivot points. 

> Definition: Homologous points are corresponding pairs of points in two digital images identified as the representation of the same underlying physical point, called pivot point, from two perspectives.

Can homologous points work with paintings ?

Strict homology works only if there is a physical connection between the image. They are overlapping representation of the same real object/place. 

> Definition : The connection between two digital images is said to be physical if it is possible to assert, from the visual information only, that they have an overlap covering the same physicality

Given a collection C , and A ∈ C ,B ∈ C , the connection (A–B) is said to be physical if it is possible to assert, from the visual information only, that they have an overlap covering the same physicality i.e. the same object or the output of the same serial production.

Ex : 

- A is a close-up of B
- A and B are engravings coming from the same wood-block

> Definition: The physical closure of an image is the set of images for which there is path of physical connection leading to this image, the image system defined by the physical connection rule.

Given a collection C , the physical closure of an image A ∈ C is the set of images for which there is path of physical connection leading to A.

## Dimensions of similarity

### Content / Subject / Topic

Images can be related in terms opf content, subject or topic

### Morphological Patterns

Images are linked through visual connections i.e. morphological patterns. 

Pattern propagation is similar to Text Reuse

- Reconstruction of a “Philology” of images, like the tree and systems of texts. 
- Identification of the Image 0. 

Complex transmission network : Images can be linked through complex compositions of patterns. 

There is an autonomy of the subject and an autonomy of the shape. They circulate independently.

The same morphological pattern can be used in different subjects. 

Example : The arm of Leda. 

### Style and Texture

Texture is a third dimension, not clearly identified as an independant factors in Deep learning research. 

## Metrics and ordering

Agreement (intersection) of partial orderings are partial orderings. 

Collective creation of a *Morphograph* (𝓓)

For the morphograph to be largely consistent it is important that 𝜔p → 𝜔(𝓓), the knowledge of any person should tend to the knowledge of everyone.  

A search engine can be built using deep learning network trained on a partial Morphograph. 

This search engine helps building a finer and wider Morphograph. 

## Summary 

Various forms of connections exist between images, from the overlapping of the same “reality” to an organised order of morphological similarity. 

## In the next chapter

We will explore how the image processing pipeline can compute automatically large image networks and morphographs.
