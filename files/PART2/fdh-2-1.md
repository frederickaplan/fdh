# Digitisation Processes

## These

1) Document digitisation is a problem of conversion of dimensions

2) Digitisation is logistic optimization

3) Optimization causes risks of alientation

4) Digitisation does not equate with an easier accessibility 

5) As digitisation unlocks ivory towers, it faces many resistances 

## How to plan a digitisation project

Can we digitise 80km of document in 10 years

1) Estimate the number of persons

2) Decide the kind of scanners to be used

3) Estimate the size of the data storage needed

4) Estimate the overall budget

## The Story of Google Books

### Figures

Google books have digitised 25 millions books (2019 figure)

How does this compare to other initiatives

Gallica : 0.7 millions

Hathi Trust : 17 millions

There are 

~ 32 millions books at the Library of Congress

~ 271 millions book files in the OCLC / WordCat catalog

(Corresponding to 1.8 billions books from 72 000 public and private libraries)

There are 

~ 32 millions books at the Library of Congress

~ 271 millions book files in the OCLC / WordCat catalog

(Corresponding to 1.8 billions books from 72 000 public and private libraries)

\- Almost 1 million new books are published each year. 

After having digitalized its first million books, the Michigan Library measured the following values.

25.8 km

680 tons

361 Million pages

70 000 Millions words

42 Terabytes

428 Languages

For 25 million books 

645 km

17 000 tons

9 025 Million pages

1 750 000 Millions words

1050Terabytes

Among these 25 million books only a subpart is online for copyright reasons. It is estimated that out of copyright books represent only 20% of the entire set (Alain Jacquesson estimate). Contrary to Gallica and other public book repository, the largest part of Google Books base is composed of commercially exploitable books. This will play a key role in the Google Book story. 

### Chronology

#### 1996-1997 : Google and Books are intrinsically linked

Google Books is in Google's DNA.
The beginning of the company are tighly linked with the Stanford Digital Library Technologies Project.
The goals was to build Crawlers to analyze book contents.
Page and Brin’s Idea : The relevance of a book will be computed based on the quantity and the quality of the citations of this book in other books. The first algorithm to do this is called “BackRub”. It will be the basis of PageRank, the algorithm that made Google success. 

4 years after Google was created, a small team think again about the project. Marissa Mayer (future Google Vice-president and then CEO of Yahoo) joins the team. 

#### 2002-2003 : Birth of a project

Page and Mayer do book turning experiments (with a metronome).

Result : 40 minutes for 300 pages. 

Then, they start a “tour” to visit the most important digital libraries projects. Library of Congress, Gutenberg Project, Million Book project, etc.

Page approaches the 5 most important libraries of the US. He starts with Michigan, because he studies their when doing its bachelor.  

Michigan is 

\- A system of 19 libraries

\- 9.2 million volumes (in 2008)

\- 180 000 new volume / year

\- participates in Jstor (digitalization of thousands of academic journals)

Page meets Mary Sue Coleman

The library of Michigan estimates that it will take 1000 years to digitalize 7 million volumes.

Page announces he can do this in only 6 years. 

Then Page goes to Stanford and meets Terry Winograd, Paul Allen, Microsoft co-founder, Michael Keller, director of the Stanford Library. When Keller comes to the GooglePlex in september 2003, Page offer to digitalize the 9 million books of the Stanford library and to put them online. Now, Page is ready to approach the Harvard University Library.

Harvard was founded in 1638

\- 90 Libraries

\- Widener Library alone counts 16 million volumes.

\- Harvard law school is 2 million volumes. 

Page meets Sydney Verba.

He is sceptic about the technical aspects of the project. Page invites him to see the scanning machines at Mountain View.

He is impressed. 

Side note : Eventually, Google will NOT use automatic scanning machines. 

In 2007, Robert Darnton replaces Verba. He will be much less enthusiastic about the Google project.

Then, Oxford and the Bodleian Library.

Founded in 1602 ..

Reg Carr is looking for funding to digitalize part of his collections.

He meets Raymond Nasr, head of Google communication.

In 2004, Google sign a deal to digitalise 1 million 19e century books in the public domain. 

New York Public Library is a famous building of the 5e avenue

\- 16 million documents

\- Paul Leclerc is interested for public domain and not too fragile books.

#### 2004 : Project Ocean

Google is working on the technical aspects of the projects.

Susan Wojcicki is piloting (future responsible of advertising, future YouTube director in 2014, sister of Anna Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe and former wife of Sergei Brin)

A couple of small disclosure in the press. But no buzz.

Some people thinks the project (Ocean) is linked with Google earth. 

Google rent a stand at the Buchmess in Frankfurt. Page and Brin presents the project Google Prints for Editors. 

They mentioned the existence of a much larger project, called Google Print, but do not give details.

Nobody takes them seriously.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine ironically titles :

“The founders of Google have found an interest for books”

14 Decembre 2004: The “earthquake” announcement of Google Print.

A collaboration with 5 major libraries (The Google 5) owning together about 50 million books.

The digitalization of several millions (with some imprecisions 6 to 15) books in less then 10 years. 

A collaborative program for publishers.

Worldwide reactions : positives and negatives.

An interesting early stage study : 

“Anatomy of Aggregate Collections: The examples of Google Print for Librairies” Brian Lavoie, Lynn Silipigni Connaway, Lorcan Dempsey

http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september05/lavoie/09lavoie.html

Brian Lavoie joined OCLC Research in 1996. Brian's academic background is in economics. At the time of writing the books have not been digitized but the data comes from Worldcat and are therefore complete. 

here are very few common books in the 5 libraries. 

61% of books in only 1 lib.

20% of books common to 2 libs.

10% of books common to 3 libs. 

6% of books common to 4 libs. 

3% of books common to 5 libs.

The older the book, the less redundancy. 

This is a very wise initial choice of libraries ! Choosing the right sequence of library digitalization saves a lot of money. 

430 languages.

Half of the documents in English. 

Only 20 % of documents are in the public domain.

But as years are passing, more books enter in the public domain. 

In the meantime, Google has a “war treasure”.

#### 2005-2008 Extensions and issues

Extension to Europe.

Starts of the trial.

University of California System (34 million)

University of Madrid (First Spanish Speaking University)

University of Wisconsin-Madison (7.2 million books)

University of Virginia (5+ million books, 17 millions manuscripts)

Université of Lausanne (100 000 books from 17 to 19e century, First french speaking library to join the project)

Negociation with Bibliothèque nationale de France starts.

New functionnalities :

 \- Places in books

\- My Library

\- Popular passages

Google makes a contract with Bibliothèque of Lyon. Based on the French law, the Google contract is disclosed. 

Europe creates Europeana, in reaction to Google Print (project preparation starts in 2005)

### The trials (2005-2015)

Class action by the Author’s guild

\- 2009 : the Google Book Settlement structures the status of the books still in commercial books. The GBS allowed to continue the program by paying for the works previously scanned and allowing authors and publishers to opt-out. 

\- The settlement is refused. In 2011 a new version is written. Also refused. 

\- The debate between Opt-in vs Opt-out

\- The problem of the The “grey zone” Oeuvres orphelines

\- 2013 : the District Court granted affirms the Google Books project met all legal requirements for **fair use**. 

“Google’s unauthorized digitizing of copyright-protected works, creation of a search functionality, and display of snippets from those works are non-infringing fair uses. The purpose of the copying is highly transformative, the public display of text is limited, and the revelations do not provide a significant market substitute for the protected aspects of the originals. Google’s commercial nature and profit motivation do not justify denial of fair use.

Google’s provision of digitized copies to the libraries that supplied the books, on the understanding that the libraries will use the copies in a manner consistent with the copyright law, also does not constitute infringement.”

## Concepts

### Transforming documents into digitised images

The Document Digitisation process transforms material documents into digital images.

It is a complex process combining human and machine intervention. 

It is also a complex transformation to understand well. We should ask two fundamental questions

\- What is a document ?

\- What is a digital image ?

#### Documents

What is a document ? What is \*not\* a document ?

A Book 

A Map

A Photograph

An Opera

A Museum

A Model

A skeleton

A Wedding

A document is a record resulting of a inscription process (writing or image).

There cannot be a document without a material inscription. 

To produce a document is to produce an object different than the object documented. 

Documents have a performative dimension, they act in the world. 

#### Digital Images

A digital image is the result of a complex algorithm and a particular hardware.

The resolution depends largely on the optics of the capturing system (diffraction, lens aberrations) and only partly on the megapixels.

An digital image is difficult to interpret if the information about the software and hardware used are not provided. 

Typologies of cameras

\- Cameras with colour filters for visible light 

\- Multispectral cameras 

Material absorption / reflectance is mostly wavelength dependent. Imaging beyond the visible spectrum allow for surface imaging (ultra-violet) and subsurface imaging (near and middle/far infrared)  

Comparative Table for Book Scanners

### Document digitisation as a problem of conversion of dimensions

Building (3D)

Room (3D)

Shelve (3D)

Book (3D)

Chapters (3D)

Page (2D)

Images / Texts (2D)

Patterns / Words (1D)

Example of an 2D interface to represent 3D content. Through digital interface, the physical hierarchy of volumes is *de facto* rearticulated in a way or another on the screen. 

Digitisation does not equate with an easier accessibility. (Europeana Iceberg ?)

### Digitisation is logistic optimization

Logistics is the management of the flow of things. 

Like in any logistics operation, standardisation in digital process is the key.  

Part of the problem is already solved as the physical archive has been thought as an optimised interface. 

Concept of the Library/Machine.

In the library/machine, the circulation of the humans has been thought symmetrically to the circulation of objects. 

To trace object circulation, one must associate each physical object with a unique ID. It must become a document, ready to be manipulated through a standardised process.

Two examplars of the same book must have two different ID. It most cases, the ID is the ID of one container (book, box)

Through standardization, the digitisation process can be estimated using simple metrics: Pages or Kilometers. 

A digitization price / page or / km can be established.

In many cases, it is impossible to know a priori the number of pages and therefore, the estimation in km is the only option. 

### Alienation

Alienation is one of the risk of the optimisation process. 

Operators become one part of a bigger machine. 

Working against alienation: Working in pairs.

Manipulating relevant document. 

Having a chance to mine the archive. 

Example of the Replica Scanner. 

### On demand digitisation

With on demand digitisation, one can ask for the digitisation of a specifically chosen document. 

The digitisation is requested and is done in a couple of days/weeks. 

Once the digitisation is done is it downloadable directly form the website.  

In many system, digitisation assets are organised by Tier, from data very often used to data never checked.  

One can consider Physical document as “not cached” content. Digitisation is putting a document at higher level tier. 

An undigitised document is a document for which a longer retrieving time should be expected. 

### Optimisation of the choice of sources

Part of the success of the Google books projects is based on an optimal choice of sources. 

Most of digitisation project are done with a specific goal linked with a specific documentary funds.

In larger scale projects, can we optimise the choice of the document to digitize ?

What should be the criteria to optimise ?

- Fragility.

- Popularity

- Information richness.

The case of optimisation for information richness is a case of application the optimal experiment approach. 

Gain (and reinforcement) is evaluated in terms of knowledge gain or uncertainty reduction. 

An algorithm can optimise this criteria. 

## Summary

Digitisation is not a series of tricks and good practices.

Its subject is the study of optimal actions in the physical and digital worlds in terms of selection, documentation, acquisition in order to lead to a potential increase in knowldege. 

The progressive change of scale of the practices shows that is should be considered a true branch of information sciences. 

Could/Should the machine help us optimise our patrimonial conservation and exploration strategies?

### In the next Chapter

In the next chapter we will study how to represent the structure of a document
