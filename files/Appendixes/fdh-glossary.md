# Glossary

### Writing Systems
#### Linear alphabet
#### Glyph, grapheme, script, writing system

### Big Cultural Dataset
A form of cultural dataset that has the characteristics of Data Bigness: i.e. being hard to process, open-ended, fundamentally networked, or sufficiently dense to lead to data-driven approach. It is proposed that Digital Humanities is the name given to the only field that can adequately deal with such Big Cultural Datasets.

### Big Data Narratives

Big Data is based on two narratives:

- **The Data Deluge narrative**: Big Data is a reaction to an unexpected abundance of information.
- **The Big Science narrative**: Big Data is a structured effort by the international scientific community to crack very hard problems by joining research forces and creating large-scale infrastructures, thus creating unprecedented amounts of data.

### Concretization
As suggested by philosopher Gilbert Simondon, a process by which different systems put in close contact will tend to aggregate to form a new unified system.

### Data Bigness

Data Bigness has four dimensions:
- **Technological breaks**: _Big Data is big in the sense that it “hurts” to compute it using traditional “manual” methods._
- **Open-endedness**: _Big Data is big when it is in a state of continuous open-ended expansion._
- **Intrinsic relations**: _Big Data is big not only because of its size but because of its relationship with other data and its “fundamentally networked” nature._
- **Paradigm shifts**: _Big Data is big when there is sufficient data to perform new forms of data-driven sciences._

### Digital Humanities

- **Soft Definition**: Digital Humanities constitute an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of Humanities and Digital approaches. Digital Humanities will remain a diaphragm zone.

- **Hard Definition**: Digital Humanities constitute a field of its own, studying a new kind of objects: _Big Cultural Data Sets_. Digital Humanities will be a new independent domain.

### Digital Humanities Circle
The self-reinforcing loop of new sources digitisation, whereby digitisation leads to better data and services, thus better services, which in turn yield more resources and more digitisation.

The ability to close this loop guarantees the sustainability of a digitisation project.

### Distant Reading
As articulated by Franco Moretti in the early 2000s, a form of literary criticism which raises above the narrowness of a specific domain of interest ("close reading") by considering a wider corpus of texts and sources – thus, as if reading from a distance –, often by means of algorithmic approaches and computational formalisms.

### Dominions
- Temporal dominion: predicting periodic rhythms and chronological patterns.
- Natural dominion: understanding and classifying living beings.
- Cultural dominion: monitoring and tracking human fluxes of exchanges (including the production of articacts, migration, urbanization, etc.).

### Fictional Space
A self-coherent subset of the available information.

Any fictional space constitutes an hypothetical virtual reconstruction of History, and thus may not be compatible with other fictional spaces – in which case they are said to be disjointed.

### Information Mushroom
A metaphor to highlight the fact that most information about the past is still hidden and has to be harvested through, not only vast digitisation projects, but also the reconstruction of the past logic of representation – by means of extrapolation and generalisation.

### Mirror World (to develop?)
A 4D digital twin of space, enriched with time-evolving relevant cultural information.

### Redocumentation (to develop?)
Redocumentation is the joint-action of two processes in order to widen our temporal horizon:
- Recollecting: the selection and rejection of some data and sources.
- Remapping: the bending of data to fit new regulated representations.

### Regulated Representation
A form of representation governed by a set mechansism, which encompasses both production and usage rules. Examples include maps, flow-chart diagrams, or name indexes.
