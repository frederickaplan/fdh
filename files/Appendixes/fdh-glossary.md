# Glossary

### Big Data Narratives

Big Data is based on two narratives : The Data Deluge story and the Big Science story. 

### Data Bigness

Data Bigness has four dimensions : Technological breaks, Open-endedness, Intrinsic Relations and Paradigm shifts.  

### Digital Humanities 

- Soft Definition : Digital Humanities constitute an interdisciplanary field at the intersection of Humanities and Digital approaches. Digital Humanities will remain a diaphragm zone. 
- Hard Definition : Digital Humanities constitue a field of its own, studying a new kind of objects : Big Cultural Data Sets. Digital Humanities will be a new independent domain.
