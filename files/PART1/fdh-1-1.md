# What are Digital Humanities

Digital Humanities is a just a word. A recent one. It means what those you decide to call themselves digital humanist decide. 

This first chapter discusses the various meaning and ambiguities of the use of word "Digital Humanities".

## Digital Humanities are often defined as a diaphgram zone at the intersection of the Digital and Humanities 

We can easy decompose the word "Digital Humanities" into its two compenents

**Digital Humanities = Digital + Humanities**

Digital systems represent information using discrete values, where analog system representing information using a continuous function. The word digital comes from digit and digitus (finger un Latin) because fingers are used for discrete counting

Humanities include a series of disciplines : ancient and modern languages, literature, history, philosophy, religion, visual and performing arts, anthropology, area studies, communication studies, cultural studies, law, linguistics. 

Scholars that work in the Humanities are called humanists. The term humanist is also linked with the Renaissance idea of humanism (e.g. Erasmus is a humanist). Scholars working in the Humanities are not necessarily humanists in the philosophical sense. 

Humanities Computing (a term essentially used before 2000) was about applying computational approaches to Humanities research questions. … Digital methods applied to literature, history, etc. 

## Finding and Organising Patterns is common to both Computer Science and the Humanities

One consequence of the use of digital methods in the humanities was the evolution of the traditional disciplinary frontiers.Various disciplines discovered that they were dealing with similar objects and methods (databases, pattern recognition, etc.). There were more similarities between disciplines trying to use computational methods to study their subject, then inside other disciplines.

Indeed, event if they are not always aware about it, most research in the humanities is about finding patterns or organising patterns (linguistic, musical, historical, etc.). 

Computers can be defined as pattern organisers. Therefore they have the potential to operate a restructuration of knowledge in the Humanities. 

The link between Computer Science and Humanities is deeper.

Noam Chomsky established the connection between Linguistics and computer Science. He was considering Panini as his spiritual father. Indeed, Panini invented a formal system of rules that was used nearly 2500 years laters as the underlying formalism of programming language. Chomsky’s way of defining grammar, inspired by Panini, served as pattern for the structure of the ALGOL compiler. 

## "Digital Humanities" is a new word, translated in many languages

The terminological change from Humanities Computing to Digital Humanities has been attributed to John Unsworth, Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, editors of the monograph A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004). 

Contrary to Humanities Computing, the term Digital Humanities covered both the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects, and symmetrically the use of digital technology for studying Humanities objects.

Many researchers in Digital Humanities insisted on the importance of practice over theory.

One of the early stage specifity of this community was the organization of THATCamp, The Humanities and Technology Camp, open, inexpensive meetings where humanists and technologists of all skill levels learn and build together in sessions proposed on the spot. The slogan of the THATCamps was More hack, less yacks.

In the same line, Claire Warwick suggested a very open definition: \*If you think you are doing it, then you probably are.\*

Between 2010 and 2020, Digital Humanities expanded as a global multilingual phenomena. The Digital Humanities 2014 Call for Paper has been translated in 14 languages by volunteers.This raised the question on how to translate the term Digital Humanities in other languages? Italian for instance still use the term Informatica umanistica which is closer from humanities computing than Digital Humanities.

In the French speaking world, there was a quite intense debate. The official translation of Digital in French is numérique. So many French researcher use the term Humanités numériques. In French speaking Switzerland, the term Humanités digitales has been preferred because of the richer reference to digitus (the finger) and the related concepts of \*doigté\*. Digital Humanities include a lot of hands-on approaches : Humanities that you do not only with your brains but also with your fingers.

## "Digital Humanities" are a subpart of the Digital Studies

Bernard Stiegler argued that the term Digital Humanities is too narrow and that the effects of digitalization go beyond the field of the Humanities to affect all the knowledge fields. He preferred the term Digital studies by opposition to Analog studies.The effects of digitalization must also be studied on fields like physics, biology, geology and other natural sciences. 

## Summary

Humanities and computer science have long standing intrinsic links.

Digital Humanities can be approximatively defined as intersection zone between the Digital and the Humanities. Digital Humanities are a part of the digital studies and include Humanities Computing and Studies about Digital Culture. 

As digital methods tend to dissolve frontiers, some reorganisation of practises have started and new communities of practice have emerged. 

## In the next chapter

Some researchers are not satisfied with the definition of Digital Humanities as a diaphragm zone and try to define Digital Humanities as a field of its own.
