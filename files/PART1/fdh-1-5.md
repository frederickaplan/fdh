## 1. Introduction: Two worlds in one

Imagine, just like Philippe Aigrain did in his book "_Cause Commune_", that an extraterrestrial creature arrives on Earth and has to report on what it sees. Its account would probably state the existence of two worlds in one.

- In the first world, some programmers are writing **free software used in the entire world** that can be compared in complexity with some of the greatest machines ever made. Large communities of people collaborate at planetary scale to create free and common knowledge bases. Based on some clear successes, a series of actors protect and cultivate the idea of commons both in the physical sphere (water, air, climate, etc.) and the information sphere.

- In the second world, very large companies are simultaneously producing **standard content, that is the adapted for local markets**. Large amounts of money are used to publicise these contents and an arsenal of tools are used to protect the right to use them. With the help of algorithms used to optimally target content to the right consumers, huge profits are made leading to more monopolistic situations.

**_These two world coexist._**

By a strange twist of technology history, they were created out of the same dynamics, through a series of tensions and divergence in the history of computing.

## 2. Defining the Commons

What are the commons ? Two ambiguous definitions :
- what is currently not owned and shared;
- what cannot be owned.

### 2.1. The distinctions in Roman law

Already in the Roman law on property, things were divided according to the possibility of their ownership.

- **_Res nullius_**: **things that belong to no master yet**. For example: a field that is now free but could be taken in the future; a wild animal that can be captured; an island which just appeared and can be taken, a diamond found in a cave.

- **_Res communes_**: **things that, by definition, cannot be owned**. For example: air, running water, the sun, the stars, the sea, the sea shores.

- **_Res usibus publicis relictae_**: **things that are voluntarily left for public usage**. For example: roads, rivers, theatres.

### 2.2. Tragedy of the enclosures vs. Tragedy of the commons

In 1944, Polanyi recalled in _The Great Transformation_ the story of the enclosures: a general trend in Europe between the XVIth and XVIIIth centuries, whereby most common fields were privatised (i.e. enclosed), and their freedom of use prevented — a process viewed negatively by Polanyi. In his _Capital_, Karl Marx argued that this enclosing phenomenon was one of the birth processes of Capitalism, as means to profit were favoured over shared commodity. This is referred as the **“The Tragedy of the Enclosures”**.

As a response to this position, Garrett Hardin published in 1968 an article entitled **“The Tragedy of the Commons”** that develops the exact opposite stance: **Common goods are fragile when the pressure of usage increases**. The collective use of a shared resource prevents self-responsability and often (if not always) leads to the degradation or depletion of the resource –– even if this is contrary to the users' common interest.

Hardin (just like Forster Lloyd before him) argues that an owner, especially when motivated by profit, is needed to maintain the good in a proper condition. This social dilemna has been summarised by Hardin: **"Injustice is preferable to total ruin."**

## 3. Public domain vs. industrial intellectual property

### 3.1. The public domain

The public domain includes **all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.**

A mathematical formula, the discourse of parliamentary, a patent or book beyond the date of expiration are all examples of items in the public domain.

Importantly, once a work has fallen into the public domain, it cannot be privatised anymore.

### 3.2. Focus: Intellectual property during the digital revolution (Von Neumann vs. Eckert and Mauchly dispute)

The loose-handedness of the definition of unpatentable works has lead, and still does, to vast legal battles. We'll now take a notable example from the first days of computing.

John von Neumann, John Presper Eckert, John Mauchly, and Hermann Goldstine where working together on the ENIAC: the first Turing-complete machine, capable in theory of solving all possible computations.

While Eckert and Mauchly **wanted to patent the conception of this computer** (like any other machine they could have invented), Von Neumann thought that the computer was capturing **fundamental aspects of mathematics and logics** and thus that it was important not to patent it.

**Eckert and Mauchly lost** after several years of legal dispute (_Honeywell, Inc. v. Sperry Rand Corp., 1973_) as Hermann Goldstine's distribution of Von Neumann's detailed notes was judged a prior publication, thus part of **common knowledge and invalidating any possible patent.**

Not only has the Von Neumann case made possible the public use of the digital computer, it was also the first of a long series of **public domain inventions**, including the “Huffman code” (Douglas Huffman, 1952) used in many lossless compression applications.

In his _“Art of Computer Programming”_ (1960-ongoing), Donald Knuth presents the reader with an encyclopaedia of open algorithms usable in any kind of problems.

_But Knuth and others are perhaps the last representatives of days past, of an era that hadn't lived the expansion of industrial property as we see it today._

### 3.3. Industry and the extension of intellectual property

Intellectual property was established to protect the creators and give them freedom to live from the benefit of their talent. This is the myth of the creator or the lonely inventor.

But the reality is bit different. Very few authors live from comfortable royalties; rather, some corporation accumulate vast shares of intellectual rights, with a large part of their business dedicated to the reinforcement of intellectual property.

This cultural capital is (mostly) not owned by creators, and we witness a shift towards a **market-like** stance of cultural property. For example, the extension of copyright validity (from 30 to 70 years after the death of the last "creator") gave cultural works an economic value passed to future generations.

This **drastic reduction of the public domain** — implied by temporal extensions of copyright (and their retroactive activations) — has also come more recently from the perpetual extension of the domain of possible intellectual property, which now includes:
- Molecules;
- Vegetal and animal species;
- Genes;
- Software and algorithms;
- Images;
- Database;
- Video programs ...

Software has historically been one domain with great resistence to patent protection. But change has come over the course of the century. While in 1960 software patenting was impossible, European laws have permitted it (with a first decision in 1972, which has been confirmed in the European Copyright directive in 1991, and started to be accepted in 1997-8). Today, more and more software patent are now filled.

The counterforce to this trend did not go into opposing intellectual property as such, but rather into deliberately creating open-accessed resources (ie. intellectual Commons).

## 4. Voluntary creation of commons

### 4.1. Focus: The AT&T vs. UNIX dispute

Yet again, a long dispute led to progress in terms of common intellectual property, this time between the AT&T company and the developpers of UNIX. Since 1976, Unix was indeed developed in close collaboration between universities and AT&T, which contriubuted by distributing its source code, which in turn was used by the academic community and many companies.

To maximise profit, AT&T decided in 1982 to engage in a more restrictive licensing. In reaction to this power-grabbing move, were launched:
- 1) The development of a **free version of UNIX** at Berkeley (using the BSD initials for Berkeley Software Distribution)

- 2) The **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** by Richard Stallman in 1985

### 4.2. Richard Stallman: GNU

One of Stallmann's intention with the FSF was to come up with a general framework for open software. It came to life with the **GNU (recursively, GNU's Not Unix)** project.

Most softwares that form a part of GNU are licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)** (first version: 1989). The aim of the GPL was to **tackle the legal problem of _guaranteeing_ open-access**, by enforcing strong rules:

- A **viral license** extending the domain of commons (a software making use of GPL code should also be GPL-licensed).

- **The universal nature of rights**: for everybody, everywhere, and whichever use.

- The logic of “copyright” for founding common goods (the so-called **"copyleft"** approach): In the same way copyrights enforce the rights of the owner, copylefts guarantee the **rights of users to use, study, modify and diffuse**.

### 4.3. Linus Torvalds: Linux and Git

Originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds and based upon much of the GNU Project free softwares, **Linux** became the reference open-source proposal to counter proprietary exploitation systems.

**Git**, created by the same Torvalds in 2005, was also distributed under the GNU GPL and became the reference for (open-source) software versioning.

These initiatives helped foster a strong **Commons-oriented mindset**  among the software developers and users community.

### 4.4. Lawrence Lessig: Creative Commons

The work of Lawrence Lessig attempted to define new ways of putting into the public domain works for which the author does have the copyright.

These are the **Creative Commons (CC) licenses** first introduced in 2001, which can be viewed as subtle caveats on the public domain: when sharing their works under CC-licences, creators have the right of waive or reserve some of the associated rights regarding use and sharing.

The different types of CC licenses are all built of combinations of the four following **baseline rights**, and are described by the merging of each right's acronym (for example: \*CC BY-NC-ND\*):

- 1) **Attribution (BY)**: The author has to be credited.

- 2) **Share-alike (SA)**: Derivative works must take an identical licensing (ie. "not more restrictive").

- 3) **Non-commercial (NC)**: Commercial uses of the work is forbidden.

- 4) **No Derivatives (ND)**: Only identical versions of the work can be distributed and used.

## 5. Grey areas in copyrighting cultural objects

### 5.1 Copyright overreaching
#### 5.1.1. Focus: The Wenman vs. Museums dispute

The American artist Cosmo Wenman entered a series of legal battles with leading museums worldwide (the Louvre, Smithsonian, Rodin, etc.) asking for the 3D copies of ancient works (i.e. with no chance of their authors being alive) to be allowed back in the public domain.

As an example, after a few legal exchanges, the Berlin Egyptian Museum agreed to share the [3D copy of their famous Nefertiti bust](https://skfb.ly/6QSL9), with a CC license, as long as they'd be mentioned as the copy was attributed to them, shared-alike, and with any commercial use forbidden (CC BY-NC-SA).

But this remains problematic (Wenman argued): **copyright, in theory, only applies to the work it self; not a copy of it** — "especially if the original is in the public domain" (cf. [Wenman's account of the legal battle](https://reason.com/2019/11/13/a-german-museum-tried-to-hide-this-stunning-3d-scan-of-an-iconic-egyptian-artifact-today-you-can-see-it-for-the-first-time/)).

#### 5.1.2. Copyrighting reproductions of public domain works

It is the act of creation that gives copyright to the work's creator, not owning it.

A subtlety appears when we consider the act of copying as potentially "artistic": taking a photograph of an object arguably adds "something" (a potentially "artistic" point-of-view) and would justify new copyright. However, **a "verbatim" copy** (such as performed by a machine) **would not fall under the creative step category**. But this loose-distinction leaves a lot of room for debate and interpretation.

**Reproductions of Public Domain Works Should Remain in the Public Domain.** Digitization by itself doesn’t create copyright.

If the work is in the public domain, no copyright licenses should be applied, and in the case of CC licenses, which are designed to only operate where copyright exists, the application of a CC license is ineffective.

### 5.2. Copyright communication: The twelve rights statements

In an effort to lift this cloud of confusion around reusability and what constitutes a "copyrightable" process, cultural institutions (most notably Europeana and the Digital Public Library of America) have agreed upon a set of **twelve standardised rights statements**.

These 12 rights statements also aim to fill some gaps left by the Creative Commons licensing, which is not fully adapted to past cultural artefacts.

**Group 1: In Copyright**
- **(1.1) In Copyright**: The item is in copyright.
- **(1.2) In Copyright - EU Orphan Work**: Works in the European Union, for which the author is not known or cannot be located (Orphan Works). The item is nonetheless under copyright.
- **(1.3) In Copyright - Educational Use permitted**: The item is in copyright but third-parties can use it for educational purposes, without first obtaining permission.
- **(1.4) In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use permitted**: Third-parties can use this work for any non-commercial use, without first obtaining permission.
- **(1.5) In Copyright - Rights-holder(s) unlocatable or unidentifiable**: Item for which underlying copyright is reasonably assumed, but for which no right-holder has been located after diligent investigation.

**Group 2: No Copyright**

 The following rights are to be used only if a Public Domain (CC-0) usage is not possible.
- **(2.1) No Copyright - Contractual Restrictions**: The item is not restricted by copyright, but the institution is required to limit the use of that item (for privacy issues, cultural protection reasons, digitisation agreements, etc).
- **(2.2) No Copyright - Non-Commercial Use only**: Any copy, modification, use, or displaying of the item is allowed, but only for non-commercial uses. This rights statement came to be because of private-public partnerships (most notably in the Google Books project).
- **(2.3) No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restrictions**: Laws, other than copyright, may limit in some jurisdictions the use of this item.
- **(2.4) No Copyright - United States**: This item is in the Public Domain under the United States law, but that may not be so in other countries.

**Group 3: Other Copyright Stances**

The following rights are to be used only when the copyright status cannot be specified better.
- **(3.1) Other - Copyright Not Evaluated**: The organisation has not evaluated the copyright status of the object.
- **(3.2) Other - Copyright Undetermined**: The copyright status is unknown and the organisation has been unsuccessful in determining it.
- **(3.3) Other - No Known Copyright**: No conclusive copyright status has been found, but it is reasonable to assume no copyright.

## 6. Frontal collision

### 6.1. Focus: The United States vs. Aaron Swartz case

The dichotomy we mentioned in the introduction expresses itself by the parallel, indifferent existence of these two worlds (e.g. of GNU vs. proprietary OS). Sometimes, however, the collision is more dramatic.

The most famous example of these frictions is perhaps the **Aaron Swartz case**. Swartz, an early supporter of open access and Creative Commons (in addition to creating Markdown, RSS, and co-founding Reddit), made **publicly available vast batches of academic publications** in an effort to circumvent the economic rationing of scientific knowledge. Faced with a possible $1 million law case, Swartz committed suicide in 2013 and subsequently became a martyr for the open-access movement.

### 6.2. Intellectual property at the worldwide scale

Intellectual property also plays a role in the North-South divide: in the "Global South" the momentum in intellectual property is weaker and this only increases the **knowledge inequality at the global scale**. This asymmetry is likely to become an issue in the near future, when the "Enclosures vs. Commons" will come to prominence again — this time with regards to digital fields.

---

## 7. Governing with the commons

To conclude on a more positive note: Recently has stemmed the idea that **finding commons is a process of governance**.

Ensuring commons (for example, in multi-partners projects, regardless of the scale — from individuals to countries) is now thought to be an essential basis for trustful, collaborative processes — and the lack thereof is often the seed of institutional wars.

A whole new domain of management has thus emerged with the goal to organise collaboration around commons, which are **collectively recognised as precious**. And to some extent, if the commons are indeed valuable, financial sustainability is reachable.

This "commons governance" takes the form of **data commons**, which in the case of a discipline helps organising data — which in turns raises the questions of optimal standardisation (at the right moment, at the right scale).

---

## 8. Conclusion
### 8.1. Summary

- There is a war between a logic of ever increasing domain of **protected intellectual property** and the collective development of **commons and the public domain**.

- Intellectual property wars make **collaboration difficult**. The public domain is always under attack

- New approaches based on **“Governing with the commons”** may be the way forward.

### 8.2. In the next chapter

- We will illustrate the “Data commons” approach with the example of the Time Machine project.
