# The Commons

### Core theses explored in this chapter 

- There is a fight between the privatization of knowlege and the Commons
- Finding commons is a process of governance. If large-scale project do not find commons, they will be go to war. 

## Two worlds in one

Philippe Aigrain in this book “Cause commune” imagines that an extraterrestrial creature arrives on Earth and have to report on what it see, it will probably write a strange account, like if there would be two world in one. 

In the first world, some programmers are writing free software used in the entire world that can be compared in complexity with some of the greatest machines ever made. Large communities of people collaborate at planetary scale to create free and common knowledge bases. Based on some clear successes, a series of actors protect and cultivate the idea of commons both in the physical sphere (water, air, climate, etc.) and the information sphere. 

In the second world, very large companies are producing standard content, that is the adapted for local markets. Large amount of money is used to publicise these content and an arsenal of tools are used to protect the right to use them. Algorithm are used to optimally target content to the right consumers. Huge profits are realised leading to more monopolistic situations. 

These two world coexist. 

By a strange twist of technology history, they were created out of the same dynamics, through a series of tensions and divergence in the history of computing.

## Commons

### Res nullius, res communes, res usibus publicis relictae

What are the commons ? Two ambiguous definitions :

\- What is currently not owned and shared

\- What cannot be owned.

*Res nullius* Things without a Master. But that can get one. Ex: a field that is now free but can be taken, a wild animal that can be captured, a island that just appeared and can me taken, a diamond found in a cave. 

*Res communes*. Things that by definition cannot be owned. Ex : Air, running water, the sun, the stars, the beaches (le “littoral”)

*Res usibus publicis relictae:* Things voluntarily left for public usage : roads, rivers, theaters. 

### Tragedy of the enclosures vs.Tragedy of the commons

In 1944, Polanyi recall the story of the enclosures, a general trends in Europe between 16 and 18e century, privatising common fields. This is referred as the “the tragedy of the enclosures”

In 1968, Garrett Hardin publishes an article entitled “the tragedy of the commons” that develop the exact opposite points of Polanyi. Common goods are fragile when the pressure of usage increase. In some cases, ecological catastrophe can occur (fields in Sahel). “Injustice is preferable to total ruin”

## Public domain

The public domain includes *all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.* 

*E.g. a mathematical formula, the discourse of parlementary, a patent or book beyond the date of expiration.*

A work in the public domain cannot be privatised anymore.

## The industrial rise of Intellectual property

### Dispute: Von Neumann vs. Eckert, Mauchly

John von Neumann, John Presper Eckert, John Mauchly and Hermann Goldstine where working together on the ENIAC, the first Turing-completer machine, capable in theory of solving all possible computation. 

Eckert and Mauchly wanted to patent the conception of this computer, like any other machine they could have invented. 

For von Neumann, the computer was capturing fondamental aspects of mathematics and logics and it was important not to patent it.

Von Neumann won, claiming he has prior publication invalidating any possible patent. 

The von Neumann case was the first of a long series of public domain inventions, including the “Huffman code” (Douglas Huffman, 1952) used in many lossless compression applications. 

Donald Knuth in the “Art of Computer Programming” (1960-1980) produces an encyclopedia of open algorithm usable in any kind of problems. 

### Extension of the domain of intellectual property 

Intellectual property was established to protect the creators and give them freedom to live from the benefit of their talent. This is the myth of the creator or the lonely inventor.

But the reality is bit different. Some corporation accumulates stocks of intellectual rights. A large part of the business is dedicated to the services for reinforcing intellectual property. 

In 30 years the domain of possible intellectual property extended drasticly including now
- Molecules 
- Vegetal and animal species
- Genes
- Software and algorithms
- Images
- Database
- Video programs

Sofware is one domain where they were the more resistance. Nevertheless, more and more software patent are now filled. 

1960 : No patent possible

1972 : This decision is written in the European Patent Convention

1991 : Exclusion confirmed in the Copyright European directive

1997-1998 : Following the US, some software patent start to be accepted in Europe 

The copyright validy period was also importantly extended : 30, 50 and than 70 years after the death of the last “creator”. This has causes a progressive drastic reduction of the public domain. 

## Voluntary creation of commons

### Dispute: AT&T and UNIX

Since 1976, Unix was developed in close collaboration between universities and AT&T. 

AT&T was distributing with its source code. It was used by the academic community and many companines. 

In 1982, AT&T decides to engage in a more restrictive license. 

This will lead to the creation of 

\- The Free Software Foundation by Richard Stallman

\- The development of a free version of UNIX at Berkeley (using the BSD initials for Berkeley Software Distribution)

### Richard Stallman and GNU

(More here / Paul ?)

The GNU General Public License (GPL) (1984)

\- A viral license extending the domain of commons

\- Universal rights for everybody and whatever use. 

\- Use the logic of “copyright” for founding common goods (copyleft approach)

\- Copyleft approach guarantees the rights of users to use, study, modify and diffuse. 

### Linus Torvalds, Linux and Git

(more here / Paul ?)

Linux (1991)

Git (2005)

### Lawrence Lessig and the Creative Commons

(more here)

## Copyright overreaching

### Dispute: Wenman vs the Museums

(more here / Paul ?)

### Reproduction of public domain works

Reproductions of Public Domain Works Should Remain in the Public Domain

Digitization by itself doesn’t create copyright

If the work is in the public domain, no copyright licenses should be applied, and in the case of CC licenses, which are designed to only operate where copyright exists, the application of a CC license is ineffective.

## Communication about copyright 

(Decription of the 12 right statements / Paul ?)

## Frontal collision

(more here / Paul ?)

- The case of Aaron Swartz
- The global south 

## Governing with the commons

Finding commons is a process of governance. If large-scale projects do not find commons, they will be go to war. 

The goal is to organise collaboration around commons collectively recognised as precious. 

If the commons are indeed valuable, financial sustainability is reachable. 

A Database organizes data for a project

A data warehouse organizes data for an organization

Data commons organize data for a field or discipline.



## Summary

- There is a war between a logic of ever increasing domain of protected intellectual property and the collective development of commons and the public domain. 
- Intellectual property wars make collaboration difficult. The public domain is always under attack
- New approaches based on “Governing with the commons” may be the way forward

## In the next chapter

- We will illustrate the “Data commons” approach with the example of the Time Machine project.
