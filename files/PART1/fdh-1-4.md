# Patrimonial capitalism

## Core theses explored in this chapter 

- Digital Humanities projects are organised as a self-reinforcing circles

- Patrimonial capitalism lead to monopols and concentration of Big Cultural Datasets

## The genealogical tree of humankind

In the heart of Granite Mountain, a few kilometres from Salt Lake City, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church, protects its treasure in a vault: 3.5 billion images of family documents compiled on microfilm. These documents provide information on the genealogy of more than 5 billion people thanks to the civil registers collected in more than a hundred countries. A non-profit organization founded in 1894, the Utah Genealogical Society  offers free access to this patiently collected gold with a series of services called FamilySearch. 

Genealogical research is at the heart of Mormon doctrine and religious practices. In the hope of a general resurrection, members of the Church rebuild their family relationships over several generations, offering each duly identified ancestor a salutary baptism. The search for an unbroken chain of links to Adam thus represents in their belief a way of saving humanity. For this reason, FamilySearch exchanges its data with other genealogical institutions, possibly for commercial purposes. 

From another cellar on Granite Mountain, ancestry.com offers as FamilySearch an interface to access a very large genealogical database, this time for a fee. The two companies have been working closely together since 2014. But Ancestry.com's commercial offering provides access to 19 billion historical records and has already attracted more than two million subscribers, who pay an average of $200 per year. In addition, the company offers a DNA test that, for less than $100, can uncover new family "connections" to people and places and already has millions of DNA profiles to help refine searches. 

Prohibited from being marketed in France by the bioethics law - which reserves them for purely scientific, judicial or medical purposes - these genealogical DNA tests are a great success worldwide. In Israel, the company MyHeritage.com has experienced a meteoric rise in the space of ten years. By successively acquiring several genealogy companies, it offers more than 80 million registered users access to 7 billion pieces of historical information. In 2013, the company signed an agreement with FamilySearch and then, in 2014, with 23andMe, the leader in genetic testing for the general public. Forced in 2013 by the US administration to abandon medical prediction, 23andMe focused on genealogy to develop its genetic profile database, the largest in the world.
These genealogy companies have, over the years, accumulated a new form of capital: genealogy capital. Its specificity? The value of each tree is all the greater as it can be related to other trees. By acquiring companies that each had a local genealogical base, MyHeritage.com has built a base whose value far exceeds the sum of the values of the initial bases. This strengthens the capital dynamics. The more genealogical information each company offers, the more subscribers its services can attract, and the more profits can be used to increase capital, either in the form of a digitisation campaign or by buying other companies in the same sector. Within a few years, this logic has led to the domination of a handful of global players who, in the absence of legislation in the field, can consolidate their monopoly position through partnerships.

The vast collections of family trees, patiently reconstructed thanks to the enthusiasm of thousands of researchers and amateurs working on public archives, have gone from being a common historical heritage to being economic capital owned by a few companies. For many researchers and amateur genealogists, this aggregation represents a step forward: search engines make it possible to navigate with great efficiency through huge databases. It is now easy to find documents on one's ancestors, when, just a few years ago, such research would have required months of work in the archives. 

However, this change in the status of historical data also raises questions about the future of large information systems that are now subject to capitalist logic. The "great tree of humanity", monopolised by a few companies, not defended as heritage and not recognised as capital, is not yet considered as a political object, but it is already an object of the global economic market. Those who own it can sell access to it to the highest bidder, attracted by an unprecedented informational resource. 

## All the images of the world

The field of genealogy is not the only sector concerned. Numerous photographic collections initially built up by art historians or research institutes have, in the same way, been grouped together in the form of iconographic databases of a commercial nature which, according to the logic of the market, have gradually been aggregated to be managed today by a handful of players. Otto Bettmann's archive, founded in 1936 on the basis of 25,000 images that he himself had produced as a museum curator, illustrates these dynamics. It was bought by Corbis, William Gates' company, to create an iconographic capital of 100 million images, a collection whose ambition was to cover the whole of human existence, also protected in the cellars of a mountain, this time in Boyers, Pennsylvania. Eventually, the company has been acquired by the Visual China Group, which, together with Getty Image, is responsible for the commercial management of this treasure. 

## The Digital Humanities Circle

These genealogical and iconographic examples are only particular cases of a broader phenomenon: patrimonial capitalism. 

Patrimonial capitalism is natural effect of the Digital Humanities Circle,  the process linking the digitisation of sources, their processing, their analysis, visualisation and the creation of societal value (insight, culture) leading ultimately to the digitisation of new sources. More Digitization leads to More Content leads to More Data Extracted leads to Better Services, possibly more revenus and then more digitisation. For an genealogical company, more images means more genealogical data, better servivices and more revenus for digitisation. Likewise, for an image company, more photos means more licensed content, better services and more customers and as consequences more digitisation or acquisition of image banks. 

A digitisation project that is not capable of closing the loop is by definition not sustainable. This is one of the issue with public and  academic research. In most academic project, more digitisation may lead to more more content, more data extracted and ultimately better research and obtention of funding for doing new research not new digitisation. This is the weak link. 

## Parallelism with the race for sequencing the Human Genome

The race of mining patrimonial capital reenacts the race for sequencing the genome. In 1989, National Research Council decides to launch a large-scale-project. Simultaneously, the *Human Genome Organisation* is created in Switzerland to coordinate the research effort at planetary scale. A budget of 3 Billion $ for 15 years is allocated to the project. 

In 1998, Craig Venter with Celera Genomics enters in competition with the International consortium, arguing he can be faster using a robotised approach. He plans to reimburse the 300 million $ investment by selling the data to pharmaceutic companies. 

Can one privatsie the genome ? Is it a common good ? A big debate starts.

In March 2000, President Clinton and Tony Blair announced that the genome sequence could not be patented, and should be made freely available to all researchers. The biotechnology sector lost about $50 billion in market capitalization in two days.

## Summary

- Historical archive documents are becoming digital capital with a high integrative value, whereas heritage data are limited resources. For this reason, we have to consider the risks of monopolistic controls on preservation, access policy and re-use. 
  Faced with these new dynamics of global capitalism, the very notion of heritage as a universal common good needs to be reinvented. 
- The large databases of the past no longer coincide today with the cultural interests of a single country or a single community. Through their spatiotemporal coverage, they have acquired a global dimension and for this reason they must be thought of as a critical resource for preparing our future.
- The only way to avoid a full privatisation is to enlarge the commons.
