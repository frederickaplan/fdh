# Introduction

This manual is called Foundations of Digital Humanities. This title in itself is a paradox. Digital Humanities is born as a diaphragm area between different fields, a zone of encounter. How can it have foundations ? Doesn't it this sound presumptious ?

### Principia Humanística

This already happened in the history of philosophy with the mathematical transformation of logics. 

Historical link with the evolution of logic

- Russel / Whitehead and Principia Mathematica
- Wittgenstein / Tractactus logico-philosophicus / les limites de mon langage sont les limites de ma pensée

Whereas AI and Cognitive Science deals with the modelisaiton of thinking process, DH deals with the modelisaiton of documentation process. 

Some of the models that may not work for modeling thinking process (GOFAI) are well suited for modelling human representations. 

Note : 

- Russel and Whitehead spend thousands of pages demonstrating that 1+1 =2 using the logic of Peano. 

- One of the foundation of Principia Mathematica is that a set is different than the element it contains. This is the issue. Latour and others will show that the solution is in flat ontology. (Cf theory des types logiques and les fondemental de l'arithmetique de Gottlob Frege)

### N=ALL

DH deals with all the document of the world. Not specific corpora. 

In this sense, it follows McLuhan's intuition the medium is the message. 

Documentation processes are more important than specific document. 




## The DH are starting a Revolution

Hard DH
The restructuration of knowledge
The societal importance of DH

## Some early axioms of a new theory

Foundation  / Axioms
1 : shape is history 
2 : pattern is knowledge / compression
3 : causality is understanding / explanation



## Documents are the beginning not the model 



## Understanding what are documents, texts, images and history

## The aeshetics of FDH

A small set of common principle offering a refondation of the humanities and computer science. 

## Ambition of FDH

Complete conceptual and practical handbook

## The Structure of  FDH

Learning Concepts, learming Skills

3 visions : what is possible ? What is likely to happen ? What is desirable to have happen ? Science, engineering, ethics 

Concentrate on fundamentals 

The past was once the future and the future will become the past 

Doing the job with style is important

Education is what, when and why to do things. Training is how to do it
