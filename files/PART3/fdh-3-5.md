# Latent Spaces

GAN, etc.  

Universal representation. 



## Mathematical foundations

- Calculus

- LInear algebra : vector spaces, normed spaces, linear transformation, matrices, determinant, eigenvalues, eigenvectors and matrix decompositon

- Multivariable calculus, where linear algebra and calculus comes together. Differentiation in multiple variables, gradient, first order derivative, higher order derivative

- Probability theory : Expected value, law of large numbers

- Basics of optmisation

- Mathematical statistics

   

### Algebraic Topology

Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

The shape of data

The manifold hypothesis (Goodfellow 2016) states that in many cases such as the case of natural images the support distibution pdata(x) is concentrated on a low dimensional manifold Mdata in an Euclidean space 
This manifold is assumed to have a very complex non linear structure and is hard to define explicitl

### Embeddings

"Over the last years, neural methods for learning dense meaningful latent semantic vector representations have dramatically improved the performance in natural language understanding, computer vision and audio processing, and this development justifiably raises high expectations for digital humanities applications".

Word2Vec (but also item2Vec, StarSpace (Facebook))

Also TF-IDF
