# 4D Processing

## The 4D Grid

The 4D Grid is a temporal cache between the 3D measures (cloud points, polygons or other 3d documents) and continuous model of reality (fictional space). 

It is a hyperdocument in this sense. 

### Temporal divisions

### Spatial divisions

Equivalence classes for time and space



Dimension

Resolution at level k 

r = 2 pi R / 2^k

with k=32, a spatial resolution of approx. 9mm at the equator is obtained.

### Spatiotemporal Indexing system

Tree structure and addessing formalism



### Storage

The total order relation enables to store efficiently the 4D grid.

A 3d volume is index with an integer in base 8. Thus a relationship of total order is reestablished in three-dimensional space. Indeed, an integer, whatever the basis on which it is expressed, can be said to be "greater than" or "smaller than" another number. Thus, points in three-dimensional space can be classified by this total-order relationship.



### Mixed models

Adding one bit to the 4D point to indicate if it is an standalone point or part of a vector. 

Transforming the logic of agregation (equivlance class) into a container logic .

Use of secondary storage system for the vector. 



## Visualizing 4D Grid

Different forms of clients

Lighting for Polygons

Rendering as a service. Vulkan. Stadia

## Computing on the 4D Grid

Predictive learning is the realm of 4D processing.

Predicting the past from the future, the east from the west, the top from the bottom.
