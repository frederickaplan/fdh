# Sub-conceptual knowledge

(Or Sub-conceptual architectures)

## Concepts

### Fundamental principles

A panorama of Deep learning methods. Successes. Fundamental principles. Neurons. Receptive Fields. Hierarchical representation / texture.

### Sub-Conceptual Content



###  Gradient descent. 

Beware of the shape of shape of the learning space

cf Prof. Lenka Zdeborov√°  "Insights on gradient-based algorithms in high-dimensional non-convex learning"

Credit Assignment Path. 



GPU Revolution 

### Most important architectures. 

- Convolutional neural networks. 

- Recurrent neural networks. 

- Siamese Networks. 

- Generative Adversarial Networks. 

- Style Transfer. 

  

## Mathematical foundations

- Calculus

- LInear algebra : vector spaces, normed spaces, linear transformation, matrices, determinant, eigenvalues, eigenvectors and matrix decompositon

- Multivariable calculus, where linear algebra and calculus comes together. Differentiation in multiple variables, gradient, first order derivative, higher order derivative

- Probability theory : Expected value, law of large numbers

- Basics of optmisation

- Mathematical statistics

   

### Algebraic Topology

Algebraic Topology 

Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

The shape of data

The manifold hypothesis (Goodfellow 2016) states that in many cases such as the case of natural images the support distibution pdata(x) is concentrated on a low dimensional manifold Mdata in an Euclidean space 
This manifold is assumed to have a very complex non linear structure and is hard to define explicitl
