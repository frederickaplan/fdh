## Historical elements

Logic in the 19th and 20th century 

- During the ninenteenth century, logic developed in a direction of a meta-mathematical diciopkine with the work of Goerge Boole (1815-1864), 
- Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) developed predicate logic and is considered the most importatn important logician since Aristote. The truth value of a complex sentence can be computed on the basis of the truh value of the elementary propositions that make that sentence. 
- This is called the princple of compositionnality (already expressed by the Indian philosopher Yaska)
- Predicate logic is the basis of more complex richer logics like modal logic and more refeindes systems of meaning referecnes (e.g. intensioanl logic)

Generative linguistics : Harris and Chomsky (maybe to move to Writing Systems Chapter)

- Chomsky's Syntactic Structure (1957) : a system of rules is needs to correctly generate all grammatical sentences rahter a structuralist system of "relation of differences". A grammar in the sense of Panini. Context-free grammar. 
- Chomsky makes a difference between performance (language use) and competence (language knowledge) . Aspect of a theory of syntax)
- This lead to the hierachy of formal languages (Three models for the description of language)
- Zellig Harris (1909-1992) had also developed a grammatical formalism known as context-free gramar. The derme contexte-free is in contract with Panini's context-sensentisive grammar (Zellig, Harris, methods in structual linguistics)
- Chomsky simplified his lniguistic theroy until he reacehd his Minimlsit Programm (1995) made of just a single combination operation, called merge. 

From Frege to Montague : Integration of linguistics and logic

- As early as Syntactic Structure (1957), Chomsky kept semantics out of the agenda. 
- The integration of linguistics and logic is one of the major achievemetn of the 20th century with effects from musicoloyg to literary studies. 
- Lambda calculus : combination of predicate logical function with richer calculus
- Montague (1930-1971) : English as a formal language (1970). The combination of three formalism : Predicate logic, Generative Grammar and Lambda Calculus leads to a new logical grammar knowm as teh Montague Grammar. However, little impact. Montague Grammar formed a school in its own right. 

Shortcomings and the rise of computational lninguistics (Rens Bod)

Categorial vers gradient aspects of language and the notion of probabilistic grammar

- There is a continuum between gramamtical and ungrammatical sentences, as well as standard and non standard language use. 
- We arrive at a theory which is statistical by nature. This lead to probabilistic grammar. 
- Also usage-based grammar and construction grammar. See Rens Bod, Beyond Grammar: An experience-based theory of language. 

Compactness versus redundancy of grammars

- Chomsky and the other generativists watnt to ahve their grammar as small as possible 
- But human language seems to be highly redundent
- In computational lingusitics most succesful applciatiosn are bbased on statistical genaratalisaiton from examples 
- Typologies of languages : free versus strict word order. Free word order language seem difficult to map with contempory grammars. 

Recent developments

- Optimalisty theory for generative grammars
- Examplar theory for statistical approaches
- Discourse representation theory for logical semantics
- A stricking lack of unity. 



## Rules-based systems and inferences

(This could be the subject of a separated chapter)

- Introdcution to first order logic: An /interpretation/ of a first-order language in a domain of interpretation, also called /model/ of language, describes the values taken by first-order constituents (variables, symbols of constants, terms) and the relationships associated with predicates. Each statement is assigned a truth value. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called /formal semantics/ or /model theory/.

- Constraint based systems
