# Deep Learning for Text and Sound

## Concepts

### Embeddings

"Over the last years, neural methods for learning dense meaningful latent semantic vector representations have dramatically improved the performance in natural language understanding, computer vision and audio processing, and this development justifiably raises high expectations for digital humanities applications".

Word2Vec (but also item2Vec, StarSpace (Facebook))

Also TF-IDF

### Discourse Vectors

Doc2Vec

Transformers

GPT-3

### Condition Random Fields

### LSTM and Bi-LSTM

### 

## Practice

### KeyPhrase extraction

### Text Reuse

### Text classification and topic modelling

### NE Extraction

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) tutorial.
