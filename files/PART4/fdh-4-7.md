# Mirror World

## Concepts

### Mirror Worlds and 4D

Digital epiderm. 

The mirror-world will aim to be an up-to-date model of the world as it is, as it was and as it will be.

All objects (including representations of landscapes) of the mirror-world will be machine-readable, and, therefore, searchable, traceable and available to be part of simulations by powerful algorithms. In the mirror world, time will be a fourth dimension, as it will be very easy to go back to the past, at any location, reverting to a previous version kept in the log. One may also travel in the other direction, as future versions of a place can be artificially created based on all information available that can be used to anticipate a predictable future. Such “time-trips” will have an increased sense of reality, as they will be based on a fullscale representation of the present world.
