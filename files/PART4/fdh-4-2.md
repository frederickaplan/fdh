# User Management

## Theses

Users are the key to the success to some platform, their most valuable asset.

… in other cases, they are just disposable anonymous workers

We will learn our to model users, motivate them and create platform that exploits their “wisdom” and “work power”

1) Massive user groups needs to be modelled

2) Massive user groups needs to be motivated

3) Massive user groups can be collectively be wise

4) Massive user groups can fund the projects 

## User modelling

Persona modelling method as a design process

\1. Identify the main user groups, what are their basic tasks and what they care for. 

\2. Associate to each user group a main persona and possibly several others. 

\3. Estimate the % of each category

\4. Develop each persona in detail 

User modelling

## Motivation and onboarding dynamics

### On-boarding cycle

1. Motivation emotion
2. Social call to action
3. User re-engagement
4. Visible progress / reward

### Case-study: Twitter

Motivating Emotion: A new user tries Twitter because she is curious about this service

Social Call to action : she discovers the two basic actions : follow people and write Tweets. she tries both.

User-rengagement : The user leaves Twitter at this stage not sure whether she will come back or not. With a little chance, someone retweets her and reply to her. She sees her name with a @ and infers the use of this typographic sign. This continues triggering her curiosity. She may comeback to continue the conversation. 

Visible progress : If her tweets are relevant, the number of her follower start to increase. This explicit measure of her importance on Twitter motivates her to continue to tweet with the more or less conscious objective to get more followers. 

As the Twitter user becomes more expert, her perception of the social engagement loop changes. 

She may track her social capital as measured by various services

She discovers the best hours for twitting and optimising RT

Consicouly or unconsciously, she optimises her writing system, to play better the game of Twitter. 

### Case-study: Quora

Quora must attract qualified contributors to write high quality answers to questions

Can you image some strategy to reach this goal ?

To attract high quality users, Quora choses a very clear strategy : Personalise the answers, anonymise the questions. 

Questions are not owned by the person who asks them. 

They are immediately treated as a common good that can be updated and modified by anyone. 

On the contrary, the interface associates strongly the user and his answers. 

The systematic juxtaposition between the id of the user (inc. pictures, name and short bio) and his answers introduces an equivalence between the value of an user and the value of his answers. 

### Case-study: Wikipedia

What kind of game is Wikipedia ?

Wikipedia is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG)

How can one climb the tiers ? What kind of privilege have the more powerful users ? The new contributor does not know it yet. 

If he persists he will discover that he can exercise different jobs in the Wikipedia worlds : Administrator, Bureaucrats, Stewards, Mediators, Judge, Bot Creator, Importator, Oversighter, IP Checkers. 

#### Administrators

Administrators are responsible for cleaning up particular pages, checking copyright issues, repair vandalism acts

All these tasks can be done by a normal user but an administrator has access to special power 

\- Erase non relavant pages

\- Protect some pages against change

\- Bloc certain users

\- Rename pages

\- Maks the history of particular pages

How does one become an administrator ? One needs to be elected. 

The following criteria are recommended 

\- A very good understanding of the Wiki syntax, rules and global functioning of the local version of Wikipedia 

\- Participation to maintenance works

\- Around 3000 participations

\- A least one year of significant activity. 

The election is set on a give day and the candidate must obtain a clear majority (this notion is not always well defined, for instance in the French version of Wikipedia)

#### IP Checkers

An IP Checker has access to the check-user function that permits to make explicit connection between a user UP and his or her account.

To become an IP Checker, one must be approved by the arbitration committee.

Only 5 persons have this privilege on the French version of Wikipedia. 

#### Oversighters

Oversighters can 

\- mask a username from al the public records

\- mask a comment

-. mask a version of a page

\- suppress a page and mask it envy to administrators

\- see overnighters’ special records 

#### Bot creators

Among the 30 most active editors on Wikipedia, 2/3 are bots.

Bots perform repetitive tasks and can interact on Wikipedia pages like a real Wikipedia user (Generate article, edit or destroy an article, translate part of an article, solve homonymy issues, correct vandalism acts)

Only a bureaucrat or a steward can allow someone to be a bot creator. 

#### Bureaucrats

Bureaucrats manage the status of other users (administrators, bots, bureaucrats=

Only 8 persons have this privilege on the French version of Wikipedia. 

#### Stewards

Steward are super bureaucrats

Stewards are appointed by the international comity. 

They can manage the status of all the others contributors. 

There are only 3 stewards on the French version Wikipedia. 

#### Mediator

They can intervene during the fights but cannot vote ore recommend a punitive action. 

#### Judges and Arbitration Committee

Judges can impose a punitive action

The ArbCom (Arbitration Committee) of the English Version of Wikipedia has only 15 members 

#### Foundational stories

The Essjay’s controversy : Essjay was an eminent member of the Wikicratia, cumulating the functions of administrators, bureaucrats, judge and mediator. 

He cas caught lying on his bio in this Wikipedia personal page and was banned. 

#### Wikipedia as World of Warcraft

World of Warcraft is so boring compared to Wikipedia

Ordinary clercks during the day. Wikipediam during the night. 

On Wikipedia with time and perseverance each play can have a double lie masked behind her or his pseudo. She or he can earn new powers as hardly obtained as the ones of a big magician in role playing heroic fantasy games. 

## Wisdow of the Crowds

### Case Study : Collective mapping

The strengh of open street map

Can the “crowds” do more than mapping in terms of knowledge creation ? Is there a theory behind these collective actions ?

### Surowiecki’s Wisdow of the Crowds

Four criteria (2004)

\1. Diversity : Each participant has different background and perspective

\2. Independence : Each participant makes their won decision

\3. Decentralization : Decision are local, no central planner

\4. Aggregation : A way to turn individual judgement into collective actions

### Collectivism vs Liberalism

Wikipedia allows for the creation of a free-for-all digital commons, and functions according to collective and community-based dynamics. It could be seen, in this sense, as a working collectivism, or even as a Marxist utopia.

Wikipedia is, however, marked by a deep liberal streak. In fact, its operation is characterized by minimal control structures, a decentralized management of conflicts, and the emergence of a community in which experts and amateurs are considered equals.

Wikipedia is the promise of knowledge progress thanks to self-regulation and a free market of contributions. An “invisible hand” guides the project so that individuals who pursue personal objectives, sometimes in competition, contribute to a common good.

### The Cathedral and the Bazaar

Open source is a form of the extension of liberalism to engineering.

“Perhaps in the end the open-source culture will triumph not because cooperation morally right or software “hoarding” is morally wrong (…), but simply because theclosed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more skilled time into a problem.”

Raymond, E. S. (1999), The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,O’Reilly Media

### The ambiguous power of the fork

Wikipedia is an open-source technology. In theory, anyone has the right to download the entire encyclopedia onto his or her own computer and even launch a competing project. The possibility of creating a fork is an open-source principle that guarantees that the project will always be a common good.

It is therefore possible, in theory, to imagine a bifurcation in the project and to propose an encyclopedia based on different technology or alternative principles. But in practice this is not so simple.

In order to protest against the possible introduction of advertising, the community of the Spanish version of Wikipedia decided to launch an alternative encyclopedia. This action attracted worldwide media attention, showing that it was possible to do it on one side, but that on the other side it was very difficult to create an alternative site that could actually compete with the principle one. Several months later, the dissident branch was reintegrated into the central project once Wikipedia assured them that it would not integrate advertising into its business model. In the end, the fork proved to be more an efficient political arm than a practical reality.

This aborted bifurcation example shows, in spite of the fact that Wikipedia is built on open-source software, that while forking Wikipedia is possible, it has a very slim chance of ever occurring. For Wikipedia is, above all, a brand name — a domain name so well established that it seems indestructible. In spite of its intrinsic openness, Wikipedia is therefore in a monopolistic situation as the first (and only) globalized interface for knowledge.

This is the case for most big open source projects.

### Managing Large-Scale Open Source Projects

… is about defining Data commons and Governing by the commons. 

If people aren’t able to find a commons, they’re falling apart.

## Crowdworking

### Case study : CAPTCHAs

Some years ago 

200+ millin CAPTCHs were solved by human around the world every day

10s / CAPTCHA

150 000 hours of work each day

### Mechanical Turk 

Artifical Artifical Intelligence 

Employers post jobs known as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), such as identifying specific content in an image or video, writing product descriptions, or answering questions, among others. 

10% fee taken by Amazon.

The average wage is 1 $ / hour. (Is Mechanical Turk a digital Sweatshop?)

Human Intelligence Task (HIT) introduces “planetary-scale Fordism”. 

Crowdflower and other services

### Fair Crowd Work

Union for crowdworkers

### The Hidden Crowd

Outsourcing content moderation to other country.

Seeing the web's darkest content 

## Crowdfunding

We can use crowdflower to judge / rank / label, deep learning generated images ?

Can we use the crowd to finance our research ?

Kickstarter : $2.95 billion in pledges 

Obama 2008 : 780 Million essentially from small donators.

Using mathematics for predicting the chances of a kickstart project

Practice : Launching a crowdfunding campaign

Can we imagine an algorithm for optimising the crowdfunding strategy of a crowdsourcing project ? 

Can an AI receive money from funder, make more money out of it, having essentially human working for it ?

Is it the future of business ?

## Summary

Users are everything : product, workers, funders. 

## In the next chapter 

We will take a look at a special kind of users : bots
